                        super impressed with the DX. The readme, the scripts and
                        the tours :chefskiss: Super good job.

                        The theme is ridiculously well put together and
                        documented. I learned a ton about Astro engineering by
                        studying it, and I've already used some of the
                        components for my web design clients. Plus, it shaved
                        hours off my dev time so I could focus on writing SEO
                        articles instead of coding something from scratch.

                        It's the cleanest template standup experience ever! I've
                        never used Astro, but looking at the demo, code, it
                        should be fairly simple pickup on top of my existing
                        React and NextJS experience

                        Cosmic Themes offers more than stunning templates built
                        on a rock-solid Astro foundationâ€”it fosters a vibrant
                        community. With value-added perks like Discord and
                        GitHub invites, Cosmic Themes is a no-brainer for anyone
                        launching a new Astro project.

                        I'm not a front-end dev, but I wanted to rebuild my

                        can't recommend enough Cosmic Themes. The entire process
                        required exactly one CSS change.

                        Cosmic Themes provides some of the best Astro themes out
                        there. They are well designed, easy to customize and,
                        most importantly, the team is very responsive concerning
                        support and feature requests. Using their themes allows
                        you to forget about the design and focus on content
                        creation.
